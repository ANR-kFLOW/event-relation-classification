# Prompt based data augmentation for event and event relation classification
 Prompt based data augmentation for event and event relation classification
# summary 

Events relashionship extraction from text is a crutial task that serves many downstream tasks (exp:Link prediction). Events relations can vary between 
temporality and causlailty, but can also go beyond causality representing other relashionship types such as Prevention, intention and enabling.

For this sake, we are trying to perform events and events relationship extraction from plain text using different deep learning techniques.
