## BERT finetuning 
BERT\SpanBERT models fine-tuning for token And sentence classification.
 
<p>To fine-tune BERT models for relation extraction, you can use the <code>sequence_classification.py</code> script. This script takes in a dataset of sentence pairs and their relation labels and fine-tunes a BERT model for relation classification.</p>

<p>To perform inference on the fine-tuned model, you can use the <code>inference.py</code> script. This script takes in a dataset of sentence pairs and performs relation classification using the fine-tuned BERT model.</p>

<p>You can download pre-trained BERT models from the following link:</p>

</ul>

<p>To fine-tune BERT models for event extraction, you can use the <code>weighted_loss.py</code> script. This script takes in a dataset of sentences and their token labels and fine-tunes a BERT model for event extraction(token classification).</p>

# GPT-3 data augmentation

Scripts for generating new sentences involving event relations, starting from definitions and examples.

 --generate_sentences: Run sentence_generation.py
 
 --generate event triggers for given sentences: Run Event_triggers_generation_by_GPT-3.py
 
 --clean generated events: Run answers_cleaning.py

# Data

The output dataset in csv format, divided in training, test and validation.
